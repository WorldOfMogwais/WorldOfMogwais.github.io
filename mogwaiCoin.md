## Summary
Mogwai Coin is an innovative and adaptive modern cryptocurrency available to everyone. Cryptocurrencies experienced an amazing level of growth in awareness, but still only a fragment of people uses them daily or even possesses a cryptocurrency wallet. One of the main goals of Mogwaicoin is to lower the hurdles for mainstream adaptation of blockchain projects by creating new incents with interaction and gamification elements, paired with a wide disposability on mobile devices and personal computers.

## Masternode Network
Masternodes are computers that run a dash wallet and make decisions, such as locking transactions with InstantSend, coordinate mixing of coins, and voting on budget funding.
Masternodes are full nodes, just like in the Bitcoin network, except that they provide a level of service to the network and require collateral to participate. Collateral is never forfeit and is safe while the masternode is operating. This allows investors to provide a service to the network, earn interest on their investment and reduce the volatility of the currency. To run a masternode, you're required to have 1000 MOG and a static IP address. For more information look at tour masternode documentation paper.
Due to the nature of the masternode rewards, the amount that you are going to receive is dependent on the total count of active masternodes.

## InstantSend
InstantSend (transaction locking and masternode consensus). This technology will allow for cryptocurrencies such as Mogwaicoin to compete with nearly instantaneous transaction systems such as credit cards for point-of-sale situations while not relying on a centralized authority. Widespread vendor acceptance of Mogwaicoin and InstantSend could revolutionize cryptocurrency by shortening the delay in confirmation of transactions from as long as an hour (with Bitcoin) to as little as a few seconds.

## PrivateSend
PrivateSend is a novel, decentralized mixer for creating an on-demand system of removing the history from coins on the network. This is mainly for fungibility, which is the attribute of money that allows any token to be exchanged with any other token, without having a difference in price in the form of a premium for tokens with less or no history. Without PrivateSend, tokens with less history would become increasingly valuable as the network grows, because of their lack of association with prior transactions. Without fungibility, there is a risk that certain tokens could be “red listed” and lose some or all of their value if at any point in the past they had been found to be used in illegal or questionable activities. Nobody wants to hold money that was involved in illegal activity, yet after the activities take place, tokens re-enter the supply and pass to new users who had no connection with the prior illegal acts. We remove this issue with the implementation of PrivateSend, which is included as part of the core protocol of the Mogwaicoin network.

## SporkSystem
The spork system is "soft fork" and "hard fork" compression, which means that Mogwaicoin developers can work across the masternode servers network and change some variables without the necessity for the client to be restarted or to install a new version. The available variables are visible by typing "spork show" in the console.
These variables do not affect the currency generation value or the masternodes control, but only programing variables to maintain the security of the network, such as the maximum instant send value.
Subsequently Mogwaicoin developers will add additional variables to make operations even safer and above all to increase the fluidity of the network.

## Decentralized Governance System
Governance in a decentralized project is difficult, because there are no central authorities to make decisions for the project. In Mogwaicoin, such decisions are made by the network, that is, by the owners of masternodes. The system allows masternodes to vote for or against proposals, which can then be implemented (or not) by Mogwaicoins developers.

## Blockchain Events
Blockchain events are triggered by predefined patterns in the blockhash. In fact, each blockhash is being verified if it contains a pattern of hexadecimal. If a pattern is found the mapped event is being executed. Events can change basic parameters on the blockchain (ex. distribution masternode & miners, block reward, difficulty). An important fact is that events start only on block following to the trigger block.

## Feed Event
One of the implemented events is called "feed". If a feed pattern is found in the blockhash, the block reward is increased (starting with the next block). The pattern itself is based on the hex values of 254 and 237. When it occurs the following seven blocks will grant higher block rewards. The multiplier will decrease by one for each block starting with eight and ending with two. Those events will play an important role when interacting with the World of Mogwais. In the current eta of Mogwaicoin we haven't implemented disadvantaging parameter changes by events. 

## Acknowledgement
Without the initiative of Satoshi Nakamoto and the team that made Bitcoin real and their continued work to build upon that vision, Mogwaicoin and the currencies that came before it would not exist. We recognize the power of the original Bitcoin creation and we honor the spirit of open source and the financial revolution it embodies, by taking what exists and striving to make it better and bringing new concept to it.

It is important to understand the origins of the Mogwai currency and the origins of much of the technical content we based on. Mogwai is a fork of the currently most actual Dash cryptocurrency and network. That means we took an existing open source licensed project and created a copy of it and then over time have been writing our own code to make the project what we envision Mogwaicoin needs to become a new kind of experience in the world of blockchain, where anyone be part in the world of Mogwai at anytime and anywhere.

We must though, acknowledge our gratitude to the Dash team for the high-quality platform they built that has allowed us to launch and build the Mogwaicoin network. Without their tireless work and dedication to creating a powerful base upon which to build our vision, Mogwaicoin would have been much more difficult to accomplish.

We want to thank and recognize the Dash team for their work. While we are pursuing a different path technically and strategically, it is in the spirit of Open Source, that we share our code just as Dash shared theirs. All of us collectively in the cryptocurrency community are working toward a better future for the planet.

Thank you,
The World of Mogwais Team
