Known bugs are tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/WorldOfMogwais/projects/1) and fixed as soon as possible.  Please note that we are only a very small team and we push forward the project in our spare time. Therefore it can take a little longer until a bug is fixed, thank you for your understanding.
