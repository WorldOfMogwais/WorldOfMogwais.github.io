## Sending Mogwai coins to the game wallet.

Before we start, we need to get some Mogwai coins in the games wallet. With these coins we will be able to create our Mogwais; send them on adventures and revive them if need be. 

**1.** Get your games wallet deposit address. We can find it at the top right portion of the screen of screen.

_For windows users: You can also you can get the address from the file **C:\Users\xxxxx\AppData\LocalLow\Mogwaicoin\WoMGameClient\mogwaikeys.txt**_

**2.** Go to your Mogwai coin wallet on your desktop and send a **minimum of 2 coins**.  In this example Iâ€™m sending 5.

After a few minutes, you should see the amount of Mogwai coins sent in the game wallet.
