A project is only as good as its community, who drive the project forward with passion and joy and tell others about it. So if you have a good idea, which is valuable for the project, please write a Enhancements proposal [here](https://github.com/orgs/WorldOfMogwais/projects/4). It will help us a lot to improve the game!
