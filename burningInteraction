## Burning Concept
The technical implementation of burning Mogwaicoins ($MOG) is processed by making a transaction to a mirror address. A mirror address is qualified by its public key not being in the range of valid private keys governed by the secp256k1 ECDSA standard used by Mogwaicoin. This will lead into a transaction where the sent coins will stay on the receiving address forever, because there isn't a valid private key to access the funds on the mirror address.
Another feature of the mirror address is that it has a unique relation to a public key and its public address. Ownership of the mirror address can be proven by exposing a signed message containing the public key and being signed by its public address.
The Concept of burning coins implements a unique deflationary factor. And is used as the only way of interacting with The World of Mogwais.

## Interaction Concept
Each mirror address is a so-called link into the world of mogwais, with an initial transaction to this mirror address you are activating the bonding process. The creation process for the mogwai consists of different factors including static and randomized factors like mirror address, blockhash, block height and so on. Interaction validation occurs by validating sent coins coming from the linked address at least partially.
