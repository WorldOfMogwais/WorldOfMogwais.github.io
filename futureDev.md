The team consists of passionate players who have already had their first playing experiences at a young age. It was computers like C64, Atari, Amiga and the first x86 PC's, which gave us beautiful gaming experiences at that time. But also with consoles like the NES, the Sega Master System and later Playstation, Xbox we had our fun.
Therefore our ideas are almost inexhaustible, unfortunately we cannot implement everything at once. :-)
